This was a fun project Rasmus Kaj and I did in 1996 for the KTH MUMS course. The goal was to create a web version of the old game "battleship" using Java applets (which were all the rage at the time). These days applet support has been removed from most web browsers, but theoretically someone could still use appletviewer from an older JDK to play the game.

This repo contains all of the web pages and assets (images & audio). The [NavalWarfare repo](https://github.com/MichaelStromberg-KTH/NavalWarfare) contains all of the Java code.
