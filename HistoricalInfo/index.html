<h2>Historical Info, Why?</h2>
<dd>In order to provide additional information about the game, we felt that it
would be a good idea to include some info about the ships you are fighting with on the
grid. We are continuously trying to make the old "Battleship" game more realistic
while still keeping it a fun and challenging game. So if you see something in here
that you feel should be implemented in NW, feel free to send us some email.
<h2>Why Naval Warfare?</h2>
<dd>How come we didn't call it Battleship 2 or something? Well the name is sort of
misleading in today's modern navy. When the original "battleship" game was created,
the battleship was the centerpiece of the navy. Today, there is no real centerpiece 
of the navy and the battleship's usefulness has declined in lieu of other support
ships.
<p>
<dd>Eventually when we add the remainder of the ships from the NW Ship Gallery, you
will be able to control an entire navy and use them as such. The original "battleship"
was pure melee (like our version is for the moment), but as you add more ships you
can possibly fire once for each ship you have.... Have more powerful weapons according
to the type of ship you have... you get the idea. So as we continue with the project,
it will be more of a challenge in managing your navy than trying to hunt down your
enemies.
<h2>Current Ship Types</h2>
<dd>Currently we have the following ship types lined up: <i>frigates, cruisers, aircraft
carriers, battleships, and destroyers</i>. Each one of these ship types will have a
different strength, weakness, and purpose. At the moment, we have modeled the game
after US Naval ship types, but we can easily expand the game to represent the
nationalities of different countries in the future. Also other naval vessels can
be used such as submarines and aircraft from the aircraft carriers.
