<h2>NW Audio</h2>
<h3>NWAudio.java</h3>

<p><dd>Initially I (Michael) did not intend on coding my own audio
applet. I wanted to find one on the net and use it in NW. The problem
was that the more I searched, the more I was displeased with the audio
applets I found. So with some encouragement from Rasmus, I decided to
code my own.</p>

<p><dd>After a short while, I thought I had an audio applet... No
sound, though. It turns out that our samples were 22kHz instead of
8kHz and in aifc format instead of au format.... So with some help
debugging from Rasmus, I eventually produced the NWAudio.java
applet.</p>

<p>Right now this applet accepts two parameters from the web page,
duration and sound file. Duration tells whether or not to loop the
sound, and the sound variable contains the sound file to be
played.</p>

<h3>SoundLib.java</h3>

<p><dd>In addition to the audio applet found on the web pages, Rasmus
coded an audio class into the one player game in order to produce
our infamous sound effects. He didn't have as much trouble coding his
class as I did with my applet...</p>

<h3>Audio Samples</h3>

<p><dd>The samples found in NW come from the PC game <b>"Beavis and
Butt-head in Virtual Stupidity"</b>. This game was awesome and rich in
sound samples. For test purposes, we decided to use the samples for
MUMS evaluation only. In no way do we take credit for these
samples. The samples are under copyright of
<a href="http://www.viacom.com/">Viacom International, Inc.</a> and we
are attempting to contact them for permission to use their samples in
NW since this is for non-profit purposes.</p>

<p><dd>We have edited the samples in order to keep them in context
with the game, and have reduced their quality (from 22kHz to 8kHz) in
order to play them in our Java audio clip code.</p>
