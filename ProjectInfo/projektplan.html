<h1>Project Definition</h1>
<ol>
<li>BATTLESHIP will be a distributed game which will allow two or more players
to engage in naval warfare on the internet.</li>
<p>
<li>The BATTLESHIP concept revolves around the childhood game with a similar
name. Here are the main phases of game play:</li>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Players start on a grid (e.g. a 10x10 matrix) and select where to place their
fleet. The fleet is usually comprised of a moderate number of ships for the matri
size. (e.g. for a 10x10 matrix perhaps 4 ships would be a good choice)</li>
<p>
<li>The ships are now fixed and cannot be moved.</li>
<p>
<li>Above the matrix where the player has placed his fleet, is another matrix
which starts out blank. This represents the matrix of his enemy. Turn by turn
he will click on one of elements in the matrix. If that element corresponds to
an element which is currently occupied by part of one of his enemy's ships, then
it is a HIT. At this point the strategy usually dictates that player will look
around that HIT region and find the rest of his ship. Otherwise it's a MISS
in which case, the player will "randomly" fire on the matrix until he finally
makes a HIT.</li>
<p>
<li>These melee turns proceed until one entire fleet is destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h1>Technical Aspects</h1>
<ol>
<li>BATTLESHIP will be coded almost exclusively in PERL using CGI scripts. Some C
code may be produced to speed up some of the graphics routines though.</li>
<p>
<li>For the first and second milestone, the matrix will be limited to only a 10x10
matrix. In the future, We are planning on producing a larger matrix to accomodate
a large fleet and/or many more players.</li>
<p>
<li>The graphics will be produced using Adobe Photoshop, Kai's Power Tools,
Wavefront, and perhaps ntitle.</li>
<p>
<li>The sound segments will be short explosions and sound effects. We are assuming
that everyone has the correct MIME types configured in they're web browser. However
we plan on having an "Options Menu", where the player may choose silent mode or
noisy mode.</li>
<p>
<li>For the first milestone, we just wanted to get the basic game engine running.
Since we're not very familiar with sockets programing for perl or Java, We've decided
that the first milestone will incorporate the use of temporary files which will 
toggle on and off when players are waiting to play, player scores, etc. After the
first milestone, we plan on spending two weeks studying sockets programming and 
experiment on implementing it into the game play.</li>
<p>
<li>Later on, if time permits, we could introduce new "weapons" which could be
used when the matrix becomes large, e.g. 100x100. A "spot radar" which would do 
a radar sweep with a 5 element radius could be implemented to "aid" in locating
other ships. We would have to experiment with how many such new "weapons" would
be allowed per game.</li>
<p>
<li>The original BATTLESHIP only involved a tiny matrix and two players. Later
a computerized one player version was introduced. Perhaps by the second milestone,
We plan on introducing at least a third player if not many more.</li>
<p>
<li>Another added implementation is to allow a limited movement instead of an attack.
This would allow the game to get more interesting. However then one would not be
able to rely on the attack matrix unless it was revamped somehow.</li>
<p>
<li>Maybe adding some modern technology to fool some of the previously mentioned
new "weapons" - stealth boats!!!!</li>
